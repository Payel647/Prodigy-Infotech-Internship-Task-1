## 🎥 **Assignment Video Script – MERN Stack Developer**

---

### 🔹 **Intro (30 seconds)**

> "Hi, my name is \[Your Name], and I’m a full-stack developer with a strong interest in building scalable, real-world web applications using the MERN stack and related technologies. In this video, I’ll walk you through two of my favorite projects where I handled both frontend and backend development. Let’s begin."

---

## 🚀 **Project 1: Hotel Booking & Listing Platform**

### 📝 **Project Summary**

> "This project is a full-featured hotel booking and listing platform. I built it to simulate a real-world accommodation platform like Airbnb, where users can sign up, log in, view hotels, and leave reviews."

> "The target users are travelers looking for accommodation and property owners who want to list their hotels."

> *(Screen share live site or localhost version)*

---

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

> * Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript
> * Backend: Node.js, Express.js
> * Database: MongoDB
> * Authentication: Passport.js
> * Image Storage: Cloudinary
> * Location Services: Maptiler
> * Templating: EJS
> * Architecture: MVC Pattern

---

### 🌟 **Key Features (Show the Code + UI)**

* **User Authentication (Signup/Login)**

  > "Implemented using Passport.js with sessions for managing users securely."

* **Cloudinary Integration**

  > "Users can upload hotel images which are stored on Cloudinary – no local storage needed."

* **REST APIs**

---

### 🙋‍♂️ **Your Role**

> "I built this entire app from scratch including backend architecture, frontend views, and integrations."

---

### ⚔️ **Challenges & Learnings**

> "Map integration and secure image handling were tricky. I learned how to securely handle third-party APIs and implement middleware for better route protection."

> "Next time, I’d like to upgrade this to React for better user experience and use JWT for stateless auth."

## 📈 **Project 2: Zerodha Clone – Real-Time Stock Trading Platform**

### 📝 **Project Summary**

> "This is a full-stack stock trading platform inspired by Zerodha. The goal was to create a platform where users could register, view live stock data, and track their portfolio."

> "The target audience is retail investors who want a clean dashboard to track stocks."

---

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

* **Frontend:** React.js, Axios, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, React Router, Chart.js
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
* **Auth & Security:** JWT, Bcrypt.js

---

### 🌟 **Key Features (Show UI + Code)**
